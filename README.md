# Movie Search App

## Project Task Description

## Objective:
Build a Movie Search Application that allows users to search for movies and view details using a movie API.

## Requirements:

    ### 1. API Integration:

    - Use a public movie API such as The Open Movie Database (OMDb API) or TMDb (The Movie Database) API. You may need to sign up for a free API key.
    - Fetch movie data based on user search queries (e.g., by movie title) and display the results.
    User Interface:

    ### 2. Create a user-friendly and responsive UI that includes:

    - A search input field where users can type the name of a movie.
    - A "Search" button to initiate the movie search.
    - A grid or list display of movie results showing:
    - Movie poster/image
    - Title of the movie
    - Year of release
    - A brief plot summary or tagline

    ### 3. Detailed View:

    - Allow users to click on a movie to view more detailed information, including:
    - Full plot synopsis
    - Cast and crew information (if available)
    - Ratings (e.g., IMDb rating)
    - Release date
    - Genre

    ### 4. Error Handling:

    Handle invalid search inputs and API errors gracefully, displaying appropriate messages to the user if no results are found or if there are problems fetching data.

    ### 5. Styling:

    - Style the application using CSS for a clean and appealing UI. Consider using Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout.
    -Optionally, use a UI component library like Material-UI or Ant Design for enhanced styling and components.

    ### 6. Additional Features (Optional):

    Implement a "Favorites" feature where users can save their favorite movie entries and view them later.
    Add pagination for search results if there are many movies.
    Allow users to filter search results by year or genre.
